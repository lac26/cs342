1. KVLite is a key-value noSQL database system.

2. I would suggest a graph database.  One of the frustrations of using a key-value database is that I could only really go one direction
(i.e. movie to actor, if I wanted to go actor to movie I had to set up another key and value).  A graph however would let you set up entities
and relationships between those entities so I could setup a 'movie' with a has-a relationship with a 'actor' and then easily add a 'in-a' relationship from actor to movie.
The edges that have properties would also allow me to specify values such as role which would be a property of the edge between Movie and Actor.

3. No, I would not be able to efficiently use my existing key-value structure to do this.  In my key-value structure under 'movie' I have 'actorToMovie' but do not have a 'movieToActor'
setup under 'actor'.

4. A scheme-less database does not require conformation to a rigid schema and does not have type limitations by column type.  This means that a key can be added with any type of value and does not need to conform to an existing schema.
This can be seen in the LoadDB file say when I create a list as a value as compared to a string as a value.  There is nothing that prevents me from saying:
            String role = actorRoles.get(i).toString();
            Value roleVal = Value.createValue(role.getBytes());
where the string is actually an array.  
Furthermore, there is nothing specifying the paths I can create.  In order to access the actors in a given movie I am simply able to make a new path "actorsToMovie" even though I had not specified such a path before.
