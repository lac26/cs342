The information returned in my J2EE application is:

With the book record, returns the condition of the book (along with what that condition means), along with the groups

and collections the book is in

DELETE book/{id}

PUT book/{id}
Reads a persons data in JSON format and updates exsiting book record
While doing this, sets the condition description to match the condition name
Also, checks to see that all groups & collections for the record are in the DB by checking for their PK

POST book

This information would be useful for the web application development because the Book is one of the key entitites in my database.
This interface woudl allow the book to be assigned to a new group or a new collection and woudl allow a user to 
delete a book or update information about the book (such as the condition).
