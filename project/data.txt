Candidate Keys
ID

The values on the LHS are a superkeys in Collection so Collection is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

BOOK COLLECTION
FDs:
none non-trivial functional dependencies

Candidate Keys
bookID, collectionID

There are no non-trivial functional dependencies so there are no LHS that must be superkeys in BookCollection so it is in BCNF.
