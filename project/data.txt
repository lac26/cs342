1 - Where I got my data
I started out by hand-generating some of the data in order to test out the relations.  I wanted data that made logical sense to start out with, i.e.
putting books in collections that made sense and sharing collections to groups that made sense.  After testing out my relations with hand-generated
data in order to generate more entries for each table I used generatedata.com (for FK I just had generatedata enter a value from 1 to my highest FK).

2- Justification of chosen normal form
I wanted to get rid of as much redundancy in my database as possible and thus wanted to ensure it was in BCNF (it would not make sense to say have 
the book information and person information in the same table and this would not follow BCNF since bookID would functionally determine book attributes and personID
would functionally determine person attributes but neither bookID or personID would be a superkey, not using BCNF means I would be avoiding redundant situations such as this one).  

3 - Demonstration that my schema satisfies my chosen normal form:

Forms by table:

PERSON
FDs:
ID -> firstName, lastName, userName, password, bPoints
userName, password -> ID, firstName, lastName, userName, bPoints

Candidate Keys:
ID
userName, password

The values on the LHS are a superkeys in Person so Person is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

CONDITION
FDs:
ID -> description

Candidate keys:
ID

The values on the LHS are a superkeys in Condidtion so Condition is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

BOOK
FDs:
ID -> author, title, edition, conditionID
author, title, edition, conditionID -> ID

Candidate Keys
ID
author, title, edition, conditionID

The values on the LHS are a superkeys in Book so Book is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

COLLECTION
FDs:
ID -> name

Candidate Keys
ID

The values on the LHS are a superkeys in Collection so Collection is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

BOOK COLLECTION
FDs:
none non-trivial functional dependencies

Candidate Keys
bookID, collectionID

There are no non-trivial functional dependencies so there are no LHS that must be superkeys in BookCollection so it is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

SHAREGROUP
FDs
ID -> name

Candidate Keys
ID

The values on the LHS are a superkeys in ShareGroup so ShareGroup is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

COLLECTIONGROUP
FDs:
none non-trivial functional dependencies

Candidate Keys
collectionID, groupID

There are no non-trivial functional dependencies so there are no LHS that must be superkeys in CollectionGroup so it is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

PERSONGROUP
FDs:
none non-trivial functional dependencies

Candidate Keys
personID, groupID

There are no non-trivial functional dependencies so there are no LHS that must be superkeys in PersonGroup so it is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.


---------

BOOKGROUP
FDs:
none non-trivial functional dependencies

Candidate Keys
bookID, groupID

There are no non-trivial functional dependencies so there are no LHS that must be superkeys in BookGroup so it is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

PERSONBOOK
FDs
bookID, ownerID -> quant

Candidate Keys
bookID, ownerID

The values on the LHS are a superkeys in PersonGroup so PersonGroup is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

---------

LOANBOOK
FDs
bookID, borrowerID, loanerID -> loanDate, loanWeeks

Candidate Keys
bookID, borrowerID, loanerID

The values on the LHS are a superkeys in LoanBook so LoanBook is in BCNF.
There are no multivalued dependencies so the relationship is in 4NF.

All of my tables are in BCNF and 4NF, therefore my relation is in 4NF.
