My idea is to design a database for a virtual library.  The potential users of this database would be anyone with books who was willing to lend or borrow books.  Is desired, the lenders could have a fee that they charged for lending the books but it would not be required.  Similar to Uber, both the lenders and the borrowers would be rated with stars so, when lending a book, both the lender and the borrower would know the other person was trustworthy.  The application would keep track of who was lending which of the lenders books, also eliminating the worry of having to remember who has what.

To start out, the tables I would want in the database Person, Book, PersonBook (since Person:Book is a many-many relationship), Group, and Group Person (because Person:Group is also a many-to-many relationship).  The group table would be say if a group of people wanted to share their libraries with each other (i.e. a household, a homeschool group, or a group of friends).  Potentially by joining that group you could have access to everyone in the group’s books.
