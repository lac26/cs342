Exercise 1.4
a) Major in Student
Course_number and Department in Course
Course_number in Section
Course_number and Prerequisite_number in Prerequisite
Thus, overall the columns that would need to change are: Major, Course_number, Department, and Prerequisite_number

b) course section and prerequisite so only one column needs to be updated

Course_number could always be a number, with out the name of the department in front of it. For example, instead of MATH2410 it would be simply 2410. The course name and the department could be a joint primary key.

c) It would be possible to change just one field if there was another table labeled DEPARMENT_NAME which matched the department (in this case that would be CS) to its name (in this case that would be CSSE).
