Advanced SQL (Section 7.1, continued) — Write sample queries that:

Implement an inner join (Section 7.1.6).

this will return all actors that have a corresponding movie:
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName
FROM	((Performer AS P JOIN Casting AS C ON P.id = C.performer ID) 
	 JOIN Movie AS M ON  M.id = C.movieID);
	 

Implement an outer join (Section 7.1.6).

this will get the status of the performers, all performers will appear rather or not they have a status (with a NULL value if no status):
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName, C.status
FROM (Performer as P LEFT OUTER JOIN Casting as C ON E.id = C.performerId);


Use an aggregate function (Section 7.1.7).

this gets the average votes for all movies in the DB:
SELECT AVG(votes) AS Average_Votes
FROM Movie;

Use grouping (Section 7.1.8).

select all performers grouped by status in movies

SELECT firstName,lastName
FROM Casting, Performer
WHERE id = movieID
GROUP BY status;
