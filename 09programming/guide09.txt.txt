Work through the following materials this week, making sure that you can do the given activities.

Read Sections 18.3-5 as follows:

18.3 - Focus on the Sections 18.3.1 & 18.3.2, skipping the material on algorithms.
Explain the nature of B+ trees.
Explain what it means for such a tree to be balanced.
18.4 - Focus on the first paragraphs, skipping Sections 18.4.1-3.
Explain the nature of multiple-key indexes
Compare and contrast tree and data pointers
18.5 - Focus on Sections 18.5.1 & 18.5.2.
Explain the nature of hash and bitmap indexes.
Compare and contrast the uses for B-tree, hash and bitmap indexes.
Read Section 19 overview (just the first three pages):

Explain the concept of query optimization.
Read Chapter 20:

Explain the concept of physical database design, in particular indexing and denormalization.
Explain the process of tuning SQL queries.
Oracle provides full documentation on its explain-plan functions, but I found this (disreputable-sounding) reference easier to use: Oracle Execution Plan Operations.

Understand and use the output of EXPLAIN PLAN to tune SQL queries.
Explain at least the following operations:
TABLE ACCESS FULL
TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX
NESTED LOOPS
HASH JOIN
INDEX UNIQUE SCAN
For Oracle’s reference documentation, see Database Performance Tuning Guide, particularly the “Using EXPLAIN PLAN” section.
