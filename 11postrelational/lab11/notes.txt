Exercise 11.1:
c) How do the external libraries (in the project pane) relate to J2SE and J2EE?

Glassfish is the J2EE.  JDK is the platform that J2EE is based on and therefore includes all of the
libraries that J2EE needs, i.e. ejb-api, servlet.jsp etc.
Since J2SE is the basic java environment that would be JDK.

d) Because GlassFish uses the JSP and servlet libraries is the Web tier.  
The display in the browser is the client tier.

e) Uses server running at port 8080
'Detected server http port: 8080'
When visit port 8080, says the 'Glassfish server' is running.
GlassFish is an application server which means it can manage J2EE applications 
(where as a web server would just hanlde HTTP requests).

f) A WAR file is an web application archive which is a directory structure that is ready for deployment 
on a web server.  It is 'exploded' because it is decompressed.  
In other words, WAR is zipped up directory structure for J2EE application.

g) A WAR file is 'exploded' if it is decompressed. 

h) A WAR file is a module loaded into the Java Application Server.  EAR files contain both WAR files and JAR files.

Exercise 11.2:
b) Uses the library javax.ws.rs-api (RESTful Web Service)
