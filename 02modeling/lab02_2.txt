1.
This can be seen as a if/then statement:
IF non null score
THEN ensure has more than 1000 votes

But can also be seen as a boolean statement:
one of these statements needs to be true
- score is null
- has more than 1000 votes

This could be expressed in SQL as (assuming there is a votes field):
CHECK (score IS NULL OR votes>1000)

2. Yes, perhaps different constrainst would have to be applied in different countries.  I.e. if the DB was being used in Europe for say a bar then the age constraint would be
18 years from birth where in the U.S. it would be 21 years from birth.  Thus, the constraint could be turned on or off depending on the country context.
There could also be a constraint about say the time of day something could happen and that constraint could be turned on or off depending on if it was summer (where it is light early)
or winter (where it is light later).
